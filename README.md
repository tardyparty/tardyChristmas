# tardyChristmas

## About
Each year the Tardy siblings do a gift exchange due to the amount of people each sibling would feel the need to buy a gift for otherwise. 

This has been a manual process for the last few years, without hard expectations or requirements.

The goal of this web app is to provide a list of who each sibling is buying for, launched automatically via email and posted to site on the same day each year.

Some nice to haves will be photo upload ability and albums/pages for all content from each year.

## Parameters 
* Couples should not be selected to buy for one another in the gift exchange.
    * Couples defined as:
        * Daniel & Emily
        * Kirk & Andrea
        * Evan & Kasey Jo
        * Cameron & Angel
        * Kristi & Austin
        * Caleb & Kasey Lynn
* Any one person should not buy for the same person within a 3 year period.
